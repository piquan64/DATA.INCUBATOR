Oh, boy, this is gonna be great.

Figure 1 shows the total number of complaints by state population. There are no evident clusters of states by debt to income ratio or education, suggesting that specific cross sections of the population are not being targeted for poor service. Complaints are associated with increased CFPB funding, but not with media chatter about the CFPB (data not shown here). Note, company names follow the same case structure as presented on the CFPB website. Sources of additional data can be found in the sumitted code.

The top panel of Figure 2 shows the number of CFPB complaints by year for the ten most complained against companies. The bottom panel of Figure 2 shows the number of CFPB complaints by year for all products offered by JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. Complaint trends are different across products. The bottom panel is just one of many examples of how the data can be parsed for visualization and analysis!
